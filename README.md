# Verilog Traffic Light Controller

## Description
A traffic light controller implemented in Verilog for FPGA simulation.  
The design uses a **clock divider** to manage timing between light changes and is simulated in **ModelSim** to verify correct behavior. This project demonstrates digital logic design, finite state machines, and hardware simulation techniques.

## Skills / Technologies
Verilog, ModelSim, FPGA Simulation, Digital Logic Design, Clock Divider, Finite State Machines

## Features
- Implements standard traffic light sequencing (Red → Green → Yellow) for multiple directions
- Uses a clock divider for precise timing control
- Fully simulated in ModelSim to verify correct operation before hardware implementation
- Modular Verilog code suitable for FPGA deployment

## Notes
This project strengthened understanding of **FSM design, timing constraints**, and the simulation workflow for digital circuits.
